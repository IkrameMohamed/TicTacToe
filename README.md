Gameplay:

The game is a classic Tic Tac Toe with a 3x3 board.
Players take turns marking squares with either crosses (X) or circles (O).
The game ends when one player wins or when the board is full (a draw).
In AI mode, the AI (player 2) uses either random moves or a minimax algorithm.
Exit the Game:
To exit the game, close the game window or press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

Additional Notes:
The game window will display the Tic Tac Toe board along with lines, crosses (X), and circles (O).
The game supports player vs. player and player vs. AI modes.
Player 1 is assigned crosses (X), and Player 2 (or AI) is assigned circles (O).
The AI uses the minimax algorithm to make decisions based on the selected difficulty level.
Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
